system: you are a helpful assistant.
user: What is the last Apple computer that you know?
assistant: As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to have up-to-date knowledge, but I can tell you that the latest Apple computer as of early 2021 is the M1 MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini. These models feature Apple's new M1 chip, which promises better performance and energy efficiency compared to previous models. Additionally, there are other Apple computers still available on the market such as the MacBook Pro 16-inch, iMac, and iMac Pro that are still popular among Apple users.
user: Okay, let's say next year Apple will launch a new line of computers which have a possible M2 chip with faster processing capabilities. What would you recommend between the M1 and this hypothetical M2 if I aim to do deep learning and machine learning algorithm?
assistant: If you are planning to do deep learning and machine learning algorithm, it is likely that you will benefit from a computer with faster processing capabilities. If Apple does indeed launch a new line of computers with an M2 chip, it is possible that the new chip will have faster processing capabilities than the M1 chip, which could be beneficial for your purposes. 

However, the decision of which chip to choose ultimately depends on the specific requirements of your workloads. Deep learning and machine learning algorithms can be very demanding in terms of computational resources, so it is important to choose a system that can handle the specific workload you are working with.

In general, if the M2 chip provides significant improvements in processing speed, it may be worth considering upgrading, especially if you often work with large datasets or perform computationally intense operations. However, it is also worth considering other factors like the cost and availability of the new line, as well as the compatibility of software and drivers with the new architecture.
user: Ok, so I am undecided between choosing the M2 with 8GB of unified RAM or to choose an M1 with 16GB of unified memory. Which one is the best considering that I don't want to spend much money?
assistant: If you are on a tight budget, choosing the M1 with 16GB of unified memory could be a better option. The M1 chip is already a high-performance processor, and the 16GB of unified memory provides enough memory capacity for most workloads. 

While the M2 chip with 8GB of unified memory may offer faster processing capabilities, having less memory could become a limitation when dealing with large datasets, running multiple deep learning or machine learning algorithms at the same time, or performing other memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, the M2 chip with 8GB of memory may be more expensive than the M1 with 16GB of memory.

Ultimately, it is important to consider not only the processing power but also memory capacity when choosing a computer for deep learning and machine learning algorithms. If you have demanding workloads, more memory will be beneficial, even if it means sacrificing some processing speed.
user: Okay, considering that I am dealing with bigger data sets, what would be the ideal size of a unified memory, which includes graphic card dedicated memory? Because I would think that 16 gigabytes is enough, but some people suggest that 24 or even higher is necessary to do this kind of work.
assistant: The ideal size of a unified memory for deep learning and machine learning algorithm depends on the size of your dataset, the complexity of your models, and the number of training or inference operations you perform. 

While 16GB of unified memory may be sufficient for many use cases, larger memory capacities can offer benefits in terms of performance and speed. If you work with large datasets and deep neural networks, or if you tend to perform multiple workloads simultaneously, you may benefit from greater memory capacity.

In general, a minimum of 16GB of unified memory is recommended for deep learning and machine learning workloads. However, if you can afford it, 24GB or even 32GB of unified memory can potentially provide significant performance improvements, especially when working with large datasets that require lots of memory. Additionally, having dedicated graphics memory (VRAM) can also improve performance, especially for tasks that involve a lot of graphics processing.

Ultimately, the ideal amount of memory (both unified memory and VRAM) for deep learning and machine learning depends on the specific needs of your use case. If you work with large data sets, it may be worth investing in a system with more memory capacity to help increase performance and productivity.
